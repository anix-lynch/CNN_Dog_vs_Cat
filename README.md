# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classifier: Build a Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow

Welcome to **Cats vs Dogs Classifier**! This project is focused on creating a deep learning model that can distinguish between images of cats and dogs using a convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow. Let’s dive into the world of image classification! 📸🔍

## 🌐 Project Overview

In this project, we’ll build a binary classifier to differentiate between images of cats and dogs. We’ll develop a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is highly effective for image classification tasks. The CNN will learn to extract key features from images and use them to classify whether the image contains a cat or a dog. We’ll split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate our model’s performance.
